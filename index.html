    <h1>The learn enough story</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous is a leader in the</b> movement to teach
      <em>technical sophistication</em>, the seemingly magical ability to take
      command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
      everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
      Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
      We believe there are <strong>at least a billion people</strong> who can benefit from
      learning technical sophistication, probably more. To join our
      movement, sign up for our official <a href="https://learnenough.com/email">email list</a> now.

        The Andromeda Galaxy (/ænˈdrɒmɪdə/), also known as <br>Messier 31,
         M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780<br> kiloparsecs 
         (2.5 million light-years) from Earth, and the nearest <br>major galaxy
          to the Milky Way.[4] <en><span style="font-size:30px; color: lightcoral"> name stems</span></en> from the area of <br>the Earth's sky
           in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda.<br>

        The 2006 observations by the Spitzer Space Telescope <br>
        revealed that the Andromeda Galaxy contains nothing.<br>
